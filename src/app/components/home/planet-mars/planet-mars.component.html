      Mars is the fouth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in
      the Solar System, being only larger than Mercury. In English, Mars carries
      the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as “Red Planet”.
      The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars’
      Surface.

      Join us on an expedition to Mars, where you can witness the beauty of its
      desolate landscapes, marvel at its geological wonders, and perhaps catch a
      glimpse of Earth shining brightly in the Martian sky.
